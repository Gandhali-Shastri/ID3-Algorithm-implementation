The code is an implementation of ID3 algorithm.

In the main function, you can edit these variables:
K = 5			-	K is for K-cross validation
max_depth = 3		-	This defines the depth of the decsion tree
			

Arguments:
Argument 1 is the attributes file and argument 2 is the sample data file.
I have also attached the data files if needed.
